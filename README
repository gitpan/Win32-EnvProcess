Win32-EnvProcess version 0.06
================================

Perl extension to set or get environment variables from
other processes on Windows only

SYNOPSIS

    use Win32::EnvProcess (:all);
    
    my $result = SetEnvProcess($pid, env_var_name, [value], ...);
    
    my @values = GetEnvProcess($pid, [env_var_name, [...]]);
    
    my @pids   = GetPids([exe_name]);
    
INSTALLATION

A C/C++ compiler is required to build this module.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test  (see TESTS below)
   nmake install

   If using the GNU toolset (for example with Strawberry Perl), 
   use dmake instead of nmake.
   
   * NON-STANDARD step *
   ---------------------
   The method used for communication with the alien process is called
   "DLL injection", which attaches a DLL to it.  Code is executed
   When the DLL is attached to the process, or a new thread is created.
   
   The DLL is named EnvProcessDll.dll does not contain any perl components;
   
   It must be copied to a directory (folder) that is on the load path
   OF THE TARGET PROCESS.  If you are not sure where that may be, try C:\Perl\bin
   (we presumably have perl installed, and it is probably in everyone's path).
   This is done by the tests by default.
   
   copy .\blib\arch\auto\Win32\EnvProcess\EnvProcessDll.dll some-directory
   
   You do not have to use the command-line for the copy, drag-and-drop with Windows
   Explorer is probably easier.
   
   * Visual Studio 2005 issues *
   -----------------------------
   The "manifest" system on this compiler needs to be taken into account by MakeMaker.
   Should you see error messages like: 
      "This application has failed to start because MSVCR80.dll was not found..."
   or
      "Runtime Error! R6034 An application has made an attempt to load the C runtime..."
   
   Then you probably need to patch MakeMaker:

   This trivial patch teaches makemaker to embed manifests in all cases that they are
   created as a side-effect from compiling under VC 2005.

   Many thanks to Yoann Pearson for his help in resolving this, and, as always, to perlmonks.
