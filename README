Win32-EnvProcess version 0.02
================================

Perl extension to set or get environment variables from
other processes on Windows only

SYNOPSIS

    use Win32::EnvProcess (:all);
    
    my $result = SetEnvProcess($pid, env_var_name, [value], ...);
    
    my @values = GetEnvProcess($pid, env_var_name, [...]);
    
INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test  (see TESTS below)
   nmake install
   
   * NON-STANDARD step *
   The method used for communication with the alien process is called
   "DLL injection", which attaches a DLL to it.  Code is executed
   When the DLL is attached to the process, or a new thread is created.
   
   The DLL is named EnvProcessDll.dll does not contain any perl components;
   
   It must be copied to a directory (folder) that is on the load path
   OF THE TARGET PROCESS.  If you are not sure where that may be, try C:\Perl\bin
   (we presumably have perl installed, and it is probably in everyone's path).
   This is done by the tests by default.
   
   copy .\blib\arch\auto\Win32\EnvProcess\EnvProcessDll.dll some-directory
   
   You do not have to use the command-line for the copy, drag-and-drop with Windows
   Explorer is probably easier.

TESTS

Currently assume you are launching the tests from cmd.exe.  This will not work if
another shell is being used.  I will probably change this to a perl script in a future release.
